  sceneDescription: 'This example scene illustrates gaze targeting, body location
    awareness, and avatar design. It contains a first person user avatar and a mirrored
    avatar, each that mimic user movements.

    

    This scene also shows how
    to launch the avatar editor. For more information on how to launch the avatar
    editor from an app, go to <i>Meta Avatars Editor Integration</i>.


    <b>Note:</b>
    The mirrored avatar is just a copy of the local avatar with some transformations
    applied. For an example that simulates a simulated remote avatar, see <i>Network
    loopback scene</i> example.'
