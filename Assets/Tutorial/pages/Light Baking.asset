    To enhance performance in
    this project, we baked lighting into lightmaps, light probes, and reflection
    probes. Using a baked directional light improves GPU performance by eliminating
    shadow generation costs.

    

    The Arena is an outdoor space with a partially
    roofed field, posing rendering and lighting challenges. Mixed Lighting was tested,
    but shadow costs were high due to the arena''s size, and quality was poor. Adding
    Cascade 4 improved visuals, but rendering costs remained excessive. We recommend
    experimenting with different configurations.

    

    To bake light effectively,
    we adjusted scene elements. These settings aren''t useful at runtime, so we created
    a script to prepare the scene before generating arena lighting.

    

    ##
    How to Bake the Arena

    

    Load the Arena Scene: [Assets/UltimateGloveBall/Scenes/Arena.unity](../Assets/UltimateGloveBall/Scenes/Arena.unity).

    

    In
    the scene hierarchy, find the disabled game object named LightingSetup.

    ![LightingSetup
    GameObject](./Media/editor/baking_gameobject_location.png)

    

    Click
    it, then use the context menu in the inspector to set up the scene.

    ![LightingSetup
    Context Menu](./Media/editor/baking_lightingsetup.png)

    

    The last
    two options configure the scene. Selecting `Setup for Lighting` enables game
    objects needed for light baking. We activate objects that emit light, enable
    backfaces not visible at runtime but necessary for proper lightmaps, set crowd
    members to contribute to GI for baked blob shadows, and configure trees to contribute
    to GI for baked shadows in lightmaps and light probes. Once set up, generate
    light from the Lighting menu. Afterward, reload the Arena scene or choose the
    `Revert after lighting` option.
